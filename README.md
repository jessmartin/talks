These are resources (slides, markdown, etc) for all of the talks I've given.

* Learn to Speak Interface: Creating Conversations Between Developers and Designers - More information at <a href="http://speakinterface.com">SpeakInterface.com</a>.
* Three Questions of a Product Champion -- You are already asking what and how. Ask who, when and why.
